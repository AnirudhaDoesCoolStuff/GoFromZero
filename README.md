# GoLearningRoadmap

A structured, hands-on journey documenting my path to mastering Go programming through daily practice, challenges, and projects—guided by AI conversations rather than traditional tutorials.

## About This Repository

This repository chronicles my personal learning journey with Go, using AI (specifically ChatGPT) as my programming tutor. I'm creating this both to document my progress and to provide a resource for others who want to learn Go in a similar way.

Each lesson is derived from interactive AI conversations that provide:

- In-depth explanations of Go concepts
- Code examples with practical applications
- Common pitfalls and edge cases
- Customized challenges with solutions and improvement feedback
- Real-world context for each concept

## Why This Approach?

I believe in learning by doing and through conversation. This approach offers:

- **Active Learning**: Engaging with concepts through questions and challenges
- **Personalized Pace**: Moving forward based on understanding, not a predetermined schedule
- **Real Problem Solving**: Tackling genuine coding challenges rather than following prescribed steps
- **Daily Consistency**: Building habits through regular practice and documentation

## For Other Learners

If you're also learning Go, feel free to:

- Follow the same progression of topics
- Try the challenges before looking at my solutions
- Use the explanations to supplement your understanding
- Fork this repository to create your own learning journey

## Learning Path

The repository follows a structured learning path inspired by Go by Example:

1. **Basics of Go**: Hello World, Values, Variables, Control Flow, Data Structures
2. **Functions and Advanced Types**: Functions, Pointers, Structs, Methods, Interfaces
3. **Concurrency**: Goroutines, Channels, Select, Synchronization
4. **Standard Library**: File I/O, JSON, HTTP, Testing
5. **Practical Projects**: Combining concepts into real-world applications
