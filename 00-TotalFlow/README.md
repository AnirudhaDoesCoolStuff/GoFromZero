Here's a structured learning plan based on "Go by Example," incorporating in-depth explanations, edge cases, challenges, and projects.

---

## **Phase 1: Basics of Go**

### Topics:

- Hello World, Values, Variables, Constants
- For, If/Else, Switch
- Arrays, Slices, Maps

### Challenges:

- Implement a simple calculator using variables and constants.
- Create a program that finds the maximum and minimum in an array.
- Build a small dictionary using maps.

### Mini-Project:

- **CLI To-Do List**: Create a command-line to-do list app that stores tasks using maps and slices.

---

## **Phase 2: Functions and Advanced Data Types**

### Topics:

- Functions, Multiple Return Values, Variadic Functions
- Closures, Recursion, Pointers
- Structs, Methods, Interfaces, Enums, Struct Embedding, Generics

### Challenges:

- Write a function that reverses a string using recursion.
- Implement a simple bank account struct with deposit and withdrawal methods.
- Create a generic function that finds the max element in a slice.

### Mini-Project:

- **Contact Book**: Build a CLI contact book that uses structs and methods.

---

## **Phase 3: Concurrency and Error Handling**

### Topics:

- Goroutines, Channels, Channel Buffering, Channel Synchronization, Channel Directions, Select, Timeouts
- Worker Pools, WaitGroups, Rate Limiting, Atomic Counters, Mutexes, Stateful Goroutines
- Errors, Custom Errors, Panic, Defer, Recover

### Challenges:

- Implement a worker pool with goroutines to process tasks concurrently.
- Handle errors in a function that divides two numbers.
- Build a retry mechanism with exponential backoff using goroutines.

### Mini-Project:

- **Parallel File Downloader**: Create a tool that downloads multiple files concurrently.

---

## **Phase 4: File Handling, Parsing, and Web Development**

### Topics:

- Reading/Writing Files, Line Filters, File Paths, Directories, Temporary Files
- JSON, XML, URL Parsing, SHA256 Hashes, Base64 Encoding
- HTTP Client, HTTP Server, Context

### Challenges:

- Parse a JSON file and extract specific fields.
- Create an HTTP client that fetches data from an API.
- Build a simple REST API using Go’s HTTP package.

### Mini-Project:

- **Weather API Client**: Create a CLI tool that fetches weather data from an API.

---

## **Phase 5: Advanced Topics and System Programming**

### Topics:

- Command-Line Arguments, Flags, Subcommands
- Environment Variables, Logging, Signals, Exit
- Spawning/Exec'ing Processes

### Challenges:

- Build a CLI tool that takes arguments and performs basic operations.
- Log events to a file with different log levels.
- Write a Go program that handles OS signals like SIGINT.

### Final Project (Choose One):

1. **URL Shortener**: A web service that shortens URLs using Go’s HTTP package.
2. **Chat Server**: A simple real-time chat application using goroutines and channels.
3. **Task Scheduler**: A background worker that executes scheduled tasks at intervals.

---

### **How This Works:**

1. We take one topic at a time, explore it in depth, including edge cases.
2. I give you challenges based on the topic. You solve them, and I review them.
3. After every few topics, we build a project to apply multiple concepts.
4. At the end, you build a final project to solidify your mastery of Go.
